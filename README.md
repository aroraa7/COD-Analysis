## Project Goal: Understanding Level Progression and Increasing User Engagement in Call of Duty  

### **Problem Statement**  
Level progression is a key driver of player engagement in Call of Duty (COD). Since we know that more **time played leads to higher engagement**, our goal is to identify what **gameplay factors contribute the most to leveling up**.  

By analyzing in-game statistics using **Ridge Regression**, we aim to determine which actions—such as kills, wins, accuracy, and survival—have the greatest impact on leveling up. Understanding these factors will allow us to design **strategies and incentives** that encourage **longer play sessions, skill-based engagement, and player retention**.  

This project will help **game developers optimize progression systems** to keep players engaged while also providing **insights for players on how to level up more efficiently**.

## Findings-Top Contributors to Leveling Up (Positive Impact)

### **1. Time Played (Most Important Factor)**
* Largest positive coefficient, meaning the more time spent playing, the higher the level.
* **What this means:** Players who grind longer hours naturally level up faster.
Time played is the strongest predictor of leveling, meaning XP and ranking systems in COD favor consistent engagement over quick efficiency.

* **How to use this insight:**
 Encourage longer gaming sessions with **daily login rewards**, **extended XP events**, and **streak-based bonuses**.

### **2. Kills (High Impact on Leveling)**
* Second strongest positive coefficient.
* **What this means:** Players who secure more eliminations per match gain XP and level up faster. Kills are directly rewarded in COD’s progression system, making kill-heavy playstyles more effective for ranking up.
* **How to use this insight:** Promote **killstreak rewards**, double XP for eliminations, and **leaderboard events** to encourage engagement.

### **3. Headshots (Accuracy Matters)**
* Strong positive coefficient.
* **What this means:** Precision and accuracy are rewarded in COD—landing headshots speeds up leveling. High-skill players who land consistent headshots progress faster than casual players.
* **How to use this insight:** Introduce **headshot bonus XP** events to encourage skill development. Create sniper-based challenges to reward precision shooters.
